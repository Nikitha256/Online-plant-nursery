        <h1>WATER APPLE</h1>
        <p>Water apple confers several benefits for human health and is prized for its therapeutic applications for treating various ailments, including heart conditions and liver disorders. The unique medicinal properties of this fleshy fruit are well-documented in traditional Indian practices of medicine - Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani.
           The name “water apple” tends to be confusing, as it is sometimes interchangeably used to refer to any plant of the Syzygium genus. Hence, it is primarily important to understand the differences in nomenclature of two common plants from the Syzygium category - the wax apple and water apple, in order to accurately highlight the nutritional values of the latter.</p>
